# Working with Ansible Playbooks
This repository includes all the files related to the [Ansible Variables]() blog post. If you want to run the examples on this repo you can execute `vagrant up` from the top of this repository in order to spin up two local vms to target with Ansible. Requirements to follow along: [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
